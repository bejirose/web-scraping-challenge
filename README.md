# Web Scraping Challenge
#### Title: Mission to Mars
#### Bejiirose K. Stanly

* Scraped the web sites using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas. *
* Created mission_to_mars.ipynb to scrape latest Mars News from 'https://mars.nasa.gov/news/', Featured Image URL from 'https://www.jpl.nasa.gov', Mars Facts from 'https://space-facts.com/mars/', and four Mars Hemispheres from 'https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars'. *
Converted mission_to_mars.ipynb to scrape_mars.py and created a route called /scrape and stored the scraped info in MongoDB under mars database. And this data is added to index.html to display into a HTML element.
The screen shot of the html template and the Database entries are in 'Screenshots of Mission to Mars.doc' and is pushed to this repository.
